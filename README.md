# Command-line cheatsheet

There are many tools to take note for command-line:

- Blog (e.g. Medium, Wordpress, Hexo)
- Note-taking application (e.g. Notion, Obsidian, VNote)
- Code snippets (e.g. VSCode snippets, IDEA snippets, GitHub gist)
- Cheatsheet tool (e.g. navi, cheat, tldr)
- Task runner (e.g. just, task, make)

After thousands of notes, I realize **task runner** is the best choice for **CLI**. Finally I choose [task](https://taskfile.dev/), a YAML-based task runner, which has excellent cross-platform experience and powerful features.

## Usage

### .env

It's allowed to write sensitive environment variables to `.local.env` file that taskfile auto reads.

## Philosophy

- Infrastructure as Code
